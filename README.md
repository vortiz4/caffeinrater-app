# CaffeinRater App

This web application will let the participant to enter their recent coffee drink they've ordered. This acts as a mini coffee journal that the participant can go back and see where and when they ordered their previous coffee orders. This is done after they had their coffee so they can refer back to that data later on.

> This is the schematics for this project planning

## How It Works

The first screen is where the participant can view all of their drinks they've entered. In "Add Drink" is where they can add their coffee drinks in a form. Once they entered, they will see "Save Successfully" appear upon submitting the coffee drink. That will be updated in the "View Your Coffee Drinks" page link in the navigation bar above.

### Other Notes

> This app is a final project for my Code Sprints C class. This course was solely focused on the server back-end programming. This is a continuation from my previous project in Code Sprints B.
