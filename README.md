# CaffeinRater App

This web application will let the participant to enter their recent coffee drink they've ordered. This acts as a mini coffee journal that the participant can go back and see where and when they ordered their previous coffee orders. This is done after they had their coffee so they can refer back to that data later on.

> This is the schematics for this project planning

## How It Works

The first screen is where the participant can view all of their drinks they've entered. In "Add Drink" is where they can add their coffee drinks in a form. Once they entered, they will see "Save Successfully" appear upon submitting the coffee drink. That will be updated in the "View Your Coffee Drinks" page link in the navigation bar above.

## Current Status :white_check_mark:

This is what is built so far. (important & new parts)

- [x] CRUD functionality
- [x] 3 unique data types
- [x] firebase collection connected
- [x] .env.local file running smoothly
- [x] project is saved in vercel and settings are all updated with the firebase credentials for the environmental variables.
  > **To be built:** The stylizing of this project could of been better if I knew more about the grid system. However, that was not the main focus of this module. Therefore, only the functionality was the main concentration this time around. (Different approach from Code Sprints A)

### Other Notes

> This app is a final project for my Code Sprints B class. This course was solely focused on cloud storage.
